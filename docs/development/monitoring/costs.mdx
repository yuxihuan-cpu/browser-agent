## Cost Tracking

To track token usage and costs, enable cost calculation:

```python
from browser_use import Agent, ChatOpenAI

agent = Agent(
    task="Search for latest news about AI",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
    calculate_cost=True  # Enable cost tracking
)

history = await agent.run()

# Get usage from history
print(f"Token usage: {history.usage}")

# Or get from usage summary
usage_summary = await agent.token_cost_service.get_usage_summary()
print(f"Usage summary: {usage_summary}")
```
